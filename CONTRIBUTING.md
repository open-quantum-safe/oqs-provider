# Contributing

The OQS core team welcomes all proposals to improve this project. This may take 
the form of [a discussion](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/discussions)
for input or feedback, possible bug reports or feature requests via [issues](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues)
as well as new code and documentation via a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls).

## Review and Feedback

We aim to provide timely feedback to any input. If you are uncertain as to whether
a particular contribution is welcome, needed or timely, please first open an [issue](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues)
particularly in case of possible bugs or new feature requests or create a
[discussion](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/discussions).

## Pull requests

Pull requests should clearly state their purpose, possibly referencing an existing
[issue](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues) when resolving it.

All PRs should move to "Ready for Review" stage only if all CI tests pass (are green).

The OQS core team is happy to provide feedback also to Draft PRs in order to improve
them before the final "Review" stage.

### New features

Any PR introducing a new feature is expected to contain a test of this feature
and this test should be part of the CI pipeline, preferably using Github CI.

## Background knowledge

New contributors are recommended to first check out documentation of the 
[OpenSSL provider concept](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/provider.html)
as well as the baseline API of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)
which are the two core foundations for this project.

## Failsafe

If you feel your contribution is not getting proper attention, please be sure to
add a tag to one or more of our [most active contributors](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/graphs/contributors).

## Issues to start working on

If you feel like contributing but don't know what specific topic to work on,
please check the [open issues tagged "good first issue" or "help wanted"](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues).
